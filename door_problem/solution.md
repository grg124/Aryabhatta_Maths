10 doors.

as squareroot of 100 is 10.

lets do it on small level

suppose there are 5 door

0 = closed
1 = opened

initially stage - 0 0 0 0 0 
1st round       - 1 1 1 1 1
2nd round       - 1 0 1 0 1
3rd round       - 1 0 0 0 1
4th round       - 1 0 0 1 1
5th round       - 1 0 0 1 0

squareroot of 5 = 2.43
So, there are 2 gates are opened.
