Suppose all persons are intelligent and don't tell who had hat on his head as nobody want to be on the island forever. 

When only one person has hat : - 

He can see that no other person has hat on his head and conclude that he has hat on his head as there must be atleast one hat. So, he go to the pond in midnight and remove the hat on that day. So only one day is required to escape from the island.

When two persons have hat : -

If two persons wear hat that means they can see each other wearing hats and thought that for each other that if there is only one hat then it will be removed on night one. If after night one , they can also see one hat then conclude that there is hat on his head also and both go in the pond on second night and removed it. SO, if there are two hats placed then after two days they will be removed.

So, through the mathematical induction , C hats can be removed in C days
