Suppose G = girl child and B = boy child having equal probability 1/2

According to the condition : -

        it, will generate following series which is an example of geomatric progression : -

                        B , GB, GGB, GGGB ...................

                        last term  = AR^n-1

                        where A = initial term,
                              R = common ratio,
                              n = No. of terms

        So , gender ration will be 1:1
