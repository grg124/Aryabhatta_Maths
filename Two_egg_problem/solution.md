it should be floor no. 14.

let x be the floor from where we should start throwing our eggs. And if the egg broken then continoulsy throwing the one left egg below floor to know the exact floor from which it is broken. SO total summation of the floor sholud be 100. the following equatin will be formed.

x + (x-1) + (x-2) + ..... + 1 = 100
x(x-1)/2 = 100
x2- x - 200 = 0

x = (-b +/- square root(b2-4*a*c))/2

where  a = 1
    b = -1
    c =  200

x = 14
